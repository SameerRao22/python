This element is extracted in the Bayer process and refined in the Hall-Héroult process. For 10 points, name this element found in corundum and bauxite with chemical symbol Al.",

Wolf-Rayet stars are the progenitors to one type of these phenomena, and the presence of hydrogenabsorption lines in their spectra leads to their Type II designation.

The Crab Nebula is aremnant of one of these phenomena that occurred in 1054. These phenomena often occur when a lack of electrondegeneracy pressure causes core collapse to a neutron star.

This is the closest Cepheid [SHE-fee-id] variable to Earth, though it is actually a triple star. This can be located by drawing a line starting in Merak and going through Dubhe [DOOB-hee], and it is also at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper. This star plays a role that used to be played by Draco [DRAY-koe]. Name this star useful to navigators because of its Northern location.",

This compound is combined with water vapor in the water-gas shift reaction, and this is mixed with hydrogen to make synthetic fuel in the Fischer-Tropsch [tropsch] process.  This compound combines with hemoglobin to create carboxyhemoglobin [kahr-BOK-see-hee-moe-gloe-bin], which causes oxygen deprivation.
